This data analytics project is focused on the 2022 T20 Cricket World Cup, which held in Australia and featured 16 competing nations and around 240 players. In order to create the dashboard, analyse different features, and determine the best players for each position throughout the World Cup, I used **Power BI**. Using this, we can quickly analyse the player statistics and determine who would be the best fit for the team. Additionally, we can select our own starting lineup from the season and select the top 11 players that performed better than expected during the World Cup.

> To interact with the dashboard you can download the pbix file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop locally.
